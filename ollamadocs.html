## Conventions

### Model names

Model names follow a `model:tag` format, where `model` can have an optional namespace such as `example/model`. Some examples are `orca-mini:3b-q4_1` and `llama3:70b`. The tag is optional and, if not provided, will default to `latest`. The tag is used to identify a specific version.

### Durations

All durations are returned in nanoseconds.

### Streaming responses

Certain endpoints stream responses as JSON objects and can optional return non-streamed responses.

## Generate a completion

```shell
POST /api/generate
```

Generate a response for a given prompt with a provided model. This is a streaming endpoint, so there will be a series of responses. The final response object will include statistics and additional data from the request.

### Parameters

- `model`: (required) the [model name](#model-names)
- `prompt`: the prompt to generate a response for
- `images`: (optional) a list of base64-encoded images (for multimodal models such as `llava`)

Advanced parameters (optional):

- `format`: the format to return a response in. Currently the only accepted value is `json`
- `options`: additional model parameters listed in the documentation for the [Modelfile](./modelfile.md#valid-parameters-and-values) such as `temperature`
- `system`: system message to (overrides what is defined in the `Modelfile`)
- `template`: the prompt template to use (overrides what is defined in the `Modelfile`)
- `context`: the context parameter returned from a previous request to `/generate`, this can be used to keep a short conversational memory
- `stream`: if `false` the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects
- `raw`: if `true` no formatting will be applied to the prompt. You may choose to use the `raw` parameter if you are specifying a full templated prompt in your request to the API
- `keep_alive`: controls how long the model will stay loaded into memory following the request (default: `5m`)

#### JSON mode

Enable JSON mode by setting the `format` parameter to `json`. This will structure the response as a valid JSON object. See the JSON mode [example](#request-json-mode) below.

> Note: it's important to instruct the model to use JSON in the `prompt`. Otherwise, the model may generate large amounts whitespace.

### Examples

#### Generate request (Streaming)

##### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3",
  "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?"
}'
```

##### Response

A stream of JSON objects is returned:

```json
{
  "model": "llama3",
  "created_at": "2023-08-04T08:52:19.385406455-07:00",
  "response": "The",
  "done": false
}
```

The final response in the stream also includes additional data about the generation:

- `total_duration`: time spent generating the response
- `load_duration`: time spent in nanoseconds loading the model
- `prompt_eval_count`: number of tokens in the prompt
- `prompt_eval_duration`: time spent in nanoseconds evaluating the prompt
- `eval_count`: number of tokens in the response
- `eval_duration`: time in nanoseconds spent generating the response
- `context`: an encoding of the conversation used in this response, this can be sent in the next request to keep a conversational memory
- `response`: empty if the response was streamed, if not streamed, this will contain the full response

To calculate how fast the response is generated in tokens per second (token/s), divide `eval_count` / `eval_duration` * `10^9`.

```json
{
  "model": "llama3",
  "created_at": "2023-08-04T19:22:45.499127Z",
  "response": "",
  "done": true,
  "context": [1, 2, 3],
  "total_duration": 10706818083,
  "load_duration": 6338219291,
  "prompt_eval_count": 26,
  "prompt_eval_duration": 130079000,
  "eval_count": 259,
  "eval_duration": 4232710000
}
```

#### Request (No streaming)

##### Request

A response can be received in one reply when streaming is off.

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3",
  "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?",
  "stream": false
}'
```

##### Response

If `stream` is set to `false`, the response will be a single JSON object:

```json
{
  "model": "llama3",
  "created_at": "2023-08-04T19:22:45.499127Z",
  "response": "The sky is blue because it is the color of the sky.",
  "done": true,
  "context": [1, 2, 3],
  "total_duration": 5043500667,
  "load_duration": 5025959,
  "prompt_eval_count": 26,
  "prompt_eval_duration": 325953000,
  "eval_count": 290,
  "eval_duration": 4709213000
}
```

#### Request (JSON mode)

> When `format` is set to `json`, the output will always be a well-formed JSON object. It's important to also instruct the model to respond in JSON.

##### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3",
  "prompt": "What color is the sky at different times of the day? Respond using JSON",
  "format": "json",
  "stream": false
}'
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "model": "llama3",
  "created_at": "2023-11-09T21:07:55.186497Z",
  "response": "{\n\"morning\": {\n\"color\": \"blue\"\n},\n\"noon\": {\n\"color\": \"blue-gray\"\n},\n\"afternoon\": {\n\"color\": \"warm gray\"\n},\n\"evening\": {\n\"color\": \"orange\"\n}\n}\n",
  "done": true,
  "context": [1, 2, 3],
  "total_duration": 4648158584,
  "load_duration": 4071084,
  "prompt_eval_count": 36,
  "prompt_eval_duration": 439038000,
  "eval_count": 180,
  "eval_duration": 4196918000
}
```

The value of `response` will be a string containing JSON similar to:

```json
{
  "morning": {
    "color": "blue"
  },
  "noon": {
    "color": "blue-gray"
  },
  "afternoon": {
    "color": "warm gray"
  },
  "evening": {
    "color": "orange"
  }
}
```

#### Request (with images)

To submit images to multimodal models such as `llava` or `bakllava`, provide a list of base64-encoded `images`:

#### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llava",
  "prompt":"What is in this picture?",
  "stream": false,
  "images": ["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"]

}
```

#### Request (Raw Mode)

In some cases, you may wish to bypass the templating system and provide a full prompt. In this case, you can use the `raw` parameter to disable templating. Also note that raw mode will not return a context.

##### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "mistral",
  "prompt": "[INST] why is the sky blue? [/INST]",
  "raw": true,
  "stream": false
}'
```

#### Request (Reproducible outputs)

For reproducible outputs, set `temperature` to 0 and `seed` to a number:

##### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "mistral",
  "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?",
  "options": {
    "seed": 123,
    "temperature": 0
  }
}'
```

##### Response

```json

  "model": "mistral",
  "created_at": "2023-11-03T15:36:02.583064Z",
  "response": " The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering.",

  "prompt_eval_duration": 119039000,
  "eval_count": 110,
  "eval_duration": 1779061000
}
```

#### Generate request (With options)

If you want to set custom options for the model at runtime rather than in the Modelfile, you can do so with the `options` parameter. This example sets every available option, but you can set any of them individually and omit the ones you do not want to override.

##### Request

```shell

#### Load a model

If an empty prompt is provided, the model will be loaded into memory.

##### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3"
}'
```

##### Response

A single JSON object is returned:

```json
{
  "model": "llama3",
  "created_at": "2023-12-18T19:52:07.071755Z",
  "response": "",
  "done": true
}
```

## Generate a chat completion

```shell
POST /api/chat
```

Generate the next message in a chat with a provided model. This is a streaming endpoint, so there will be a series of responses. Streaming can be disabled using `"stream": false`. The final response object will include statistics and additional data from the request.

### Parameters

- `model`: (required) the [model name](#model-names)
- `messages`: the messages of the chat, this can be used to keep a chat memory

The `message` object has the following fields:

- `role`: the role of the message, either `system`, `user` or `assistant`
- `content`: the content of the message
- `images` (optional): a list of images to include in the message (for multimodal models such as `llava`)

Advanced parameters (optional):

- `format`: the format to return a response in. Currently the only accepted value is `json`
- `options`: additional model parameters listed in the documentation for the [Modelfile](./modelfile.md#valid-parameters-and-values) such as `temperature`
- `stream`: if `false` the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects
- `keep_alive`: controls how long the model will stay loaded into memory following the request (default: `5m`)

  "eval_duration": 4799921000
}
```

## Create a Model

```shell
POST /api/create
```

Create a model from a [`Modelfile`](./modelfile.md). It is recommended to set `modelfile` to the content of the Modelfile rather than just set `path`. This is a requirement for remote create. Remote model creation must also create any file blobs, fields such as `FROM` and `ADAPTER`, explicitly with the server using [Create a Blob](#create-a-blob) and the value to the path indicated in the response.

### Parameters

- `name`: name of the model to create
- `modelfile` (optional): contents of the Modelfile
- `stream`: (optional) if `false` the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects
- `path` (optional): path to the Modelfile

### Examples

#### Create a new model

Create a new model from a `Modelfile`.

##### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/create -d '{
  "name": "mario",
  "modelfile": "FROM llama3\nSYSTEM You are mario from Super Mario Bros."
}'
```

##### Response

A stream of JSON objects. Notice that the final JSON object shows a `"status": "success"`.

```json
{"status":"reading model metadata"}
{"status":"creating system layer"}
{"status":"using already created layer sha256:22f7f8ef5f4c791c1b03d7eb414399294764d7cc82c7e94aa81a1feb80a983a2"}

{"status":"writing manifest"}
{"status":"success"}
```

### Check if a Blob Exists

```shell
HEAD /api/blobs/:digest
```

Ensures that the file blob used for a FROM or ADAPTER field exists on the server. This is checking your Ollama server and not Ollama.ai.

#### Query Parameters

- `digest`: the SHA256 digest of the blob

#### Examples

##### Request

```shell
curl -I http://localhost:11434/api/blobs/sha256:29fdb92e57cf0827ded04ae6461b5931d01fa595843f55d36f5b275a52087dd2
```

##### Response

Return 200 OK if the blob exists, 404 Not Found if it does not.

### Create a Blob

```shell
POST /api/blobs/:digest
```

Create a blob from a file on the server. Returns the server file path.

#### Query Parameters

- `digest`: the expected SHA256 digest of the file

#### Examples

##### Request

```shell
curl -T model.bin -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/blobs/sha256:29fdb92e57cf0827ded04ae6461b5931d01fa595843f55d36f5b275a52087dd2
```

##### Response

Return 201 Created if the blob was successfully created, 400 Bad Request if the digest used is not expected.

## List Local Models

```shell
GET /api/tags
```

List models that are available locally.

### Examples

#### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

#### Response

## Copy a Model

```shell
POST /api/copy
```

Copy a model. Creates a model with another name from an existing model.

### Examples

#### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/copy -d '{
  "source": "llama3",
  "destination": "llama3-backup"
}'
```

#### Response

Returns a 200 OK if successful, or a 404 Not Found if the source model doesn't exist.

## Delete a Model

```shell
DELETE /api/delete
```

Delete a model and its data.

### Parameters

- `name`: model name to delete

### Examples

#### Request

```shell
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:11434/api/delete -d '{
  "name": "llama3:13b"
}'
```

#### Response

Returns a 200 OK if successful, 404 Not Found if the model to be deleted doesn't exist.

## Pull a Model

```shell
POST /api/pull
```

Download a model from the ollama library. Cancelled pulls are resumed from where they left off, and multiple calls will share the same download progress.

### Parameters

- `name`: name of the model to pull
- `insecure`: (optional) allow insecure connections to the library. Only use this if you are pulling from your own library during development.
- `stream`: (optional) if `false` the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects

### Examples

#### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/pull -d '{
  "name": "llama3"
}'
```

#### Response

If `stream` is not specified, or set to `true`, a stream of JSON objects is returned:

The first object is the manifest:

```json
{
  "status": "pulling manifest"
}
```

Then there is a series of downloading responses. Until any of the download is completed, the `completed` key may not be included. The number of files to be downloaded depends on the number of layers specified in the manifest.

```json
{
  "status": "downloading digestname",
  "digest": "digestname",
  "total": 2142590208,
  "completed": 241970
}
```

After all the files are downloaded, the final responses are:

```json
{
    "status": "verifying sha256 digest"
}
{
    "status": "writing manifest"
}
{
    "status": "removing any unused layers"
}
{
    "status": "success"
}
```

if `stream` is set to false, then the response is a single JSON object:

```json
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Push a Model

```shell
POST /api/push
```

Upload a model to a model library. Requires registering for ollama.ai and adding a public key first.

### Parameters

- `name`: name of the model to push in the form of `<namespace>/<model>:<tag>`
- `insecure`: (optional) allow insecure connections to the library. Only use this if you are pushing to your library during development.
- `stream`: (optional) if `false` the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects

### Examples

#### Request

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/push -d '{
  "name": "mattw/pygmalion:latest"
}'
```

#### Response

If `stream` is not specified, or set to `true`, a stream of JSON objects is returned:

```json
{ "status": "retrieving manifest" }
```

and then:

```json
{
  "status": "starting upload",
  "digest": "sha256:bc07c81de745696fdf5afca05e065818a8149fb0c77266fb584d9b2cba3711ab",
  "total": 1928429856
}
```

Then there is a series of uploading responses:

```json
{
  "status": "starting upload",
  "digest": "sha256:bc07c81de745696fdf5afca05e065818a8149fb0c77266fb584d9b2cba3711ab",
  "total": 1928429856
}
```

Finally, when the upload is complete:

```json
{"status":"pushing manifest"}
{"status":"success"}
```

If `stream` is set to `false`, then the response is a single JSON object:

```json
{ "status": "success" }
```

## Generate Embeddings

  ]
}
```
# Development

Install required tools:

- cmake version 3.24 or higher
- go version 1.22 or higher
- gcc version 11.4.0 or higher

```bash
brew install go cmake gcc
```

Optionally enable debugging and more verbose logging:

```bash
# At build time
export CGO_CFLAGS="-g"

# At runtime
export OLLAMA_DEBUG=1
```

Get the required libraries and build the native LLM code:

```bash
go generate ./...
```

Then build ollama:

```bash
go build .
```

Now you can run `ollama`:

```bash
./ollama
```

### Linux

#### Linux CUDA (NVIDIA)

_Your operating system distribution may already have packages for NVIDIA CUDA. Distro packages are often preferable, but instructions are distro-specific. Please consult distro-specific docs for dependencies if available!_

Install `cmake` and `golang` as well as [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
development and runtime packages.

Typically the build scripts will auto-detect CUDA, however, if your Linux distro
or installation approach uses unusual paths, you can specify the location by
specifying an environment variable `CUDA_LIB_DIR` to the location of the shared
libraries, and `CUDACXX` to the location of the nvcc compiler. You can customize
a set of target CUDA architectures by setting `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` (e.g. "50;60;70")

Then generate dependencies:

```
go generate ./...
```

Then build the binary:

```
go build .
```

#### Linux ROCm (AMD)

_Your operating system distribution may already have packages for AMD ROCm and CLBlast. Distro packages are often preferable, but instructions are distro-specific. Please consult distro-specific docs for dependencies if available!_

Install [CLBlast](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast/blob/master/doc/installation.md) and [ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/) development packages first, as well as `cmake` and `golang`.

Typically the build scripts will auto-detect ROCm, however, if your Linux distro
or installation approach uses unusual paths, you can specify the location by
specifying an environment variable `ROCM_PATH` to the location of the ROCm
install (typically `/opt/rocm`), and `CLBlast_DIR` to the location of the
CLBlast install (typically `/usr/lib/cmake/CLBlast`). You can also customize
the AMD GPU targets by setting AMDGPU_TARGETS (e.g. `AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx1101;gfx1102"`)

```
go generate ./...
```

Then build the binary:

```
go build .
```

ROCm requires elevated privileges to access the GPU at runtime. On most distros you can add your user account to the `render` group, or run as root.

#### Advanced CPU Settings

By default, running `go generate ./...` will compile a few different variations
of the LLM library based on common CPU families and vector math capabilities,
including a lowest-common-denominator which should run on almost any 64 bit CPU
somewhat slowly. At runtime, Ollama will auto-detect the optimal variation to
load. If you would like to build a CPU-based build customized for your
processor, you can set `OLLAMA_CUSTOM_CPU_DEFS` to the llama.cpp flags you would
like to use. For example, to compile an optimized binary for an Intel i9-9880H,
you might use:

```
OLLAMA_CUSTOM_CPU_DEFS="-DLLAMA_AVX=on -DLLAMA_AVX2=on -DLLAMA_F16C=on -DLLAMA_FMA=on" go generate ./...
go build .
```

#### Containerized Linux Build

If you have Docker available, you can build linux binaries with `./scripts/build_linux.sh` which has the CUDA and ROCm dependencies included. The resulting binary is placed in `./dist`

### Windows

Note: The windows build for Ollama is still under development.

Install required tools:

- MSVC toolchain - C/C++ and cmake as minimal requirements
- Go version 1.22 or higher
- MinGW (pick one variant) with GCC.
  - [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
  - [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

```powershell
$env:CGO_ENABLED="1"
go generate ./...
go build .
```

#### Windows CUDA (NVIDIA)

In addition to the common Windows development tools described above, install CUDA after installing MSVC.

- [NVIDIA CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html)


#### Windows ROCm (AMD Radeon)

In addition to the common Windows development tools described above, install AMDs HIP package after installing MSVC.

- [AMD HIP](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html)
- [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/)

Lastly, add `ninja.exe` included with MSVC to the system path (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\Ninja`).

# FAQ

## How can I upgrade Ollama?

Ollama on macOS and Windows will automatically download updates. Click on the taskbar or menubar item and then click "Restart to update" to apply the update. Updates can also be installed by downloading the latest version [manually](https://ollama.com/download/).

On Linux, re-run the install script:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

## How can I view the logs?

Review the [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) docs for more about using logs.

## Is my GPU compatible with Ollama?

Please refer to the [GPU docs](./gpu.md).

## How can I specify the context window size?

By default, Ollama uses a context window size of 2048 tokens.

To change this when using `ollama run`, use `/set parameter`:

```
/set parameter num_ctx 4096
```

When using the API, specify the `num_ctx` parameter:

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3",
  "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?",
  "options": {
    "num_ctx": 4096
  }
}'
```

## How can I tell if my model was loaded onto the GPU?

Use the `ollama ps` command to see what models are currently loaded into memory.

```shell
ollama ps
NAME      	ID          	SIZE 	PROCESSOR	UNTIL
llama3:70b	bcfb190ca3a7	42 GB	100% GPU 	4 minutes from now
```

The `Processor` column will show which memory the model was loaded in to:
* `100% GPU` means the model was loaded entirely into the GPU
* `100% CPU` means the model was loaded entirely in system memory
* `48%/52% CPU/GPU` means the model was loaded partially onto both the GPU and into system memory

## How do I configure Ollama server?

Ollama server can be configured with environment variables.

### Setting environment variables on Mac

If Ollama is run as a macOS application, environment variables should be set using `launchctl`:

1. For each environment variable, call `launchctl setenv`.

    ```bash
    launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"
    ```

2. Restart Ollama application.

### Setting environment variables on Linux

If Ollama is run as a systemd service, environment variables should be set using `systemctl`:

1. Edit the systemd service by calling `systemctl edit ollama.service`. This will open an editor.

2. For each environment variable, add a line `Environment` under section `[Service]`:

    ```ini
    [Service]
    Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"
    ```

3. Save and exit.

4. Reload `systemd` and restart Ollama:

   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl restart ollama
   ```

### Setting environment variables on Windows

On Windows, Ollama inherits your user and system environment variables.

1. First Quit Ollama by clicking on it in the task bar.

2. Start the Settings (Windows 11) or Control Panel (Windows 10) application and search for _environment variables_.

3. Click on _Edit environment variables for your account_.

4. Edit or create a new variable for your user account for `OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_MODELS`, etc.

5. Click OK/Apply to save.

6. Start the Ollama application from the Windows Start menu.

## How do I use Ollama behind a proxy?

Ollama is compatible with proxy servers if `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` are configured. When using either variables, ensure it is set where `ollama serve` can access the values. When using `HTTPS_PROXY`, ensure the proxy certificate is installed as a system certificate. Refer to the section above for how to use environment variables on your platform.

### How do I use Ollama behind a proxy in Docker?

The Ollama Docker container image can be configured to use a proxy by passing `-e HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com` when starting the container.

Alternatively, the Docker daemon can be configured to use a proxy. Instructions are available for Docker Desktop on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#proxies), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/windows/#proxies), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/linux/#proxies), and Docker [daemon with systemd](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy).

Ensure the certificate is installed as a system certificate when using HTTPS. This may require a new Docker image when using a self-signed certificate.

```dockerfile
FROM ollama/ollama
COPY my-ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-ca.crt
RUN update-ca-certificates
```

Build and run this image:

```shell
docker build -t ollama-with-ca .
docker run -d -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://my.proxy.example.com -p 11434:11434 ollama-with-ca
```

## Does Ollama send my prompts and answers back to ollama.com?

No. Ollama runs locally, and conversation data does not leave your machine.

## How can I expose Ollama on my network?

Ollama binds 127.0.0.1 port 11434 by default. Change the bind address with the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable.

Refer to the section [above](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for how to set environment variables on your platform.

## How can I use Ollama with a proxy server?

Ollama runs an HTTP server and can be exposed using a proxy server such as Nginx. To do so, configure the proxy to forward requests and optionally set required headers (if not exposing Ollama on the network). For example, with Nginx:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;  # Replace with your domain or IP
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:11434;
        proxy_set_header Host localhost:11434;
    }
}
```

## How can I use Ollama with ngrok?

Ollama can be accessed using a range of tools for tunneling tools. For example with Ngrok:

```shell
ngrok http 11434 --host-header="localhost:11434"
```

## How can I use Ollama with Cloudflare Tunnel?

To use Ollama with Cloudflare Tunnel, use the `--url` and `--http-host-header` flags:

```shell
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:11434 --http-host-header="localhost:11434"
```

## How can I allow additional web origins to access Ollama?

Ollama allows cross-origin requests from `127.0.0.1` and `0.0.0.0` by default. Additional origins can be configured with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`.

Refer to the section [above](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for how to set environment variables on your platform.

## Where are models stored?

- macOS: `~/.ollama/models`
- Linux: `/usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models`
- Windows: `C:\Users\%username%\.ollama\models`

### How do I set them to a different location?

If a different directory needs to be used, set the environment variable `OLLAMA_MODELS` to the chosen directory.

Refer to the section [above](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for how to set environment variables on your platform.

## How can I use Ollama in Visual Studio Code?

There is already a large collection of plugins available for VSCode as well as other editors that leverage Ollama. See the list of [extensions & plugins](https://github.com/ollama/ollama#extensions--plugins) at the bottom of the main repository readme.

## How do I use Ollama with GPU acceleration in Docker?

The Ollama Docker container can be configured with GPU acceleration in Linux or Windows (with WSL2). This requires the [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit). See [ollama/ollama](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama) for more details.

GPU acceleration is not available for Docker Desktop in macOS due to the lack of GPU passthrough and emulation.

## Why is networking slow in WSL2 on Windows 10?

This can impact both installing Ollama, as well as downloading models.

Open `Control Panel > Networking and Internet > View network status and tasks` and click on `Change adapter settings` on the left panel. Find the `vEthernel (WSL)` adapter, right click and select `Properties`.
Click on `Configure` and open the `Advanced` tab. Search through each of the properties until you find `Large Send Offload Version 2 (IPv4)` and `Large Send Offload Version 2 (IPv6)`. *Disable* both of these
properties.

## How can I preload a model into Ollama to get faster response times?

If you are using the API you can preload a model by sending the Ollama server an empty request. This works with both the `/api/generate` and `/api/chat` API endpoints.

To preload the mistral model using the generate endpoint, use:
```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model": "mistral"}'
```

To use the chat completions endpoint, use:
```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d '{"model": "mistral"}'
```

To preload a model using the CLI, use the command:
```shell
ollama run llama3 ""
```

## How do I keep a model loaded in memory or make it unload immediately?

By default models are kept in memory for 5 minutes before being unloaded. This allows for quicker response times if you are making numerous requests to the LLM. You may, however, want to free up the memory before the 5 minutes have elapsed or keep the model loaded indefinitely. Use the `keep_alive` parameter with either the `/api/generate` and `/api/chat` API endpoints to control how long the model is left in memory.

The `keep_alive` parameter can be set to:
* a duration string (such as "10m" or "24h")
* a number in seconds (such as 3600)
* any negative number which will keep the model loaded in memory (e.g. -1 or "-1m")
* '0' which will unload the model immediately after generating a response

For example, to preload a model and leave it in memory use:
```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model": "llama3", "keep_alive": -1}'
```

To unload the model and free up memory use:
```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model": "llama3", "keep_alive": 0}'
```

Alternatively, you can change the amount of time all models are loaded into memory by setting the `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` environment variable when starting the Ollama server. The `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` variable uses the same parameter types as the `keep_alive` parameter types mentioned above. Refer to section explaining [how to configure the Ollama server](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) to correctly set the environment variable.

If you wish to override the `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` setting, use the `keep_alive` API parameter with the `/api/generate` or `/api/chat` API endpoints.

## How do I manage the maximum number of requests the Ollama server can queue?

If too many requests are sent to the server, it will respond with a 503 error indicating the server is overloaded.  You can adjust how many requests may be queue by setting `OLLAMA_MAX_QUEUE`.
# Running Ollama on Fly.io GPU Instances

Ollama runs with little to no configuration on [Fly.io GPU instances](https://fly.io/docs/gpus/gpu-quickstart/). If you don't have access to GPUs yet, you'll need to [apply for access](https://fly.io/gpu/) on the waitlist. Once you're accepted, you'll get an email with instructions on how to get started.

Create a new app with `fly apps create`:

```bash
fly apps create
```

Then create a `fly.toml` file in a new folder that looks like this:

```toml
app = "sparkling-violet-709"
primary_region = "ord"
vm.size = "a100-40gb" # see https://fly.io/docs/gpus/gpu-quickstart/ for more info

[build]
  image = "ollama/ollama"

[http_service]
  internal_port = 11434
  force_https = false
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
  processes = ["app"]

[mounts]
  source = "models"
  destination = "/root/.ollama"
  initial_size = "100gb"
```

Then create a [new private IPv6 address](https://fly.io/docs/reference/private-networking/#flycast-private-load-balancing) for your app:

```bash
fly ips allocate-v6 --private
```

Then deploy your app:

```bash
fly deploy
```

And finally you can access it interactively with a new Fly.io Machine:

```
fly machine run -e OLLAMA_HOST=http://your-app-name.flycast --shell ollama/ollama
```

```bash
$ ollama run openchat:7b-v3.5-fp16
>>> How do I bake chocolate chip cookies?
 To bake chocolate chip cookies, follow these steps:

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.

2. In a large bowl, mix together 1 cup of unsalted butter (softened), 3/4 cup granulated sugar, and 3/4
cup packed brown sugar until light and fluffy.

3. Add 2 large eggs, one at a time, to the butter mixture, beating well after each addition. Stir in 1
teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon
salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined.

5. Fold in 2 cups of chocolate chips (or chunks) into the dough.

6. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

7. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers should still be slightly soft.

8. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack
to cool completely.

Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies!
```

When you set it up like this, it will automatically turn off when you're done using it. Then when you access it again, it will automatically turn back on. This is a great way to save money on GPU instances when you're not using them. If you want a persistent wake-on-use connection to your Ollama instance, you can set up a [connection to your Fly network using WireGuard](https://fly.io/docs/reference/private-networking/#discovering-apps-through-dns-on-a-wireguard-connection). Then you can access your Ollama instance at `http://your-app-name.flycast`.

And that's it!

### GPU Selection

If you have multiple NVIDIA GPUs in your system and want to limit Ollama to use
a subset, you can set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to a comma separated list of GPUs.
Numeric IDs may be used, however ordering may vary, so UUIDs are more reliable.
You can discover the UUID of your GPUs by running `nvidia-smi -L` If you want to
ignore the GPUs and force CPU usage, use an invalid GPU ID (e.g., "-1")

### Laptop Suspend Resume

On linux, after a suspend/resume cycle, sometimes Ollama will fail to discover
your NVIDIA GPU, and fallback to running on the CPU.  You can workaround this
driver bug by reloading the NVIDIA UVM driver with `sudo rmmod nvidia_uvm &&
sudo modprobe nvidia_uvm`

## AMD Radeon
Ollama supports the following AMD GPUs:
| Family         | Cards and accelerators                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AMD Radeon RX  | `7900 XTX` `7900 XT` `7900 GRE` `7800 XT` `7700 XT` `7600 XT` `7600` `6950 XT` `6900 XTX` `6900XT` `6800 XT` `6800` `Vega 64` `Vega 56`    |
| AMD Radeon PRO | `W7900` `W7800` `W7700` `W7600` `W7500` `W6900X` `W6800X Duo` `W6800X` `W6800` `V620` `V420` `V340` `V320` `Vega II Duo` `Vega II` `VII` `SSG` |
| AMD Instinct   | `MI300X` `MI300A` `MI300` `MI250X` `MI250` `MI210` `MI200` `MI100` `MI60` `MI50`                                                               |

### Overrides
Ollama leverages the AMD ROCm library, which does not support all AMD GPUs. In
some cases you can force the system to try to use a similar LLVM target that is
close.  For example The Radeon RX 5400 is `gfx1034` (also known as 10.3.4)
however, ROCm does not currently support this target. The closest support is
`gfx1030`.  You can use the environment variable `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` with
`x.y.z` syntax.  So for example, to force the system to run on the RX 5400, you
would set `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION="10.3.0"` as an environment variable for the
server.  If you have an unsupported AMD GPU you can experiment using the list of
supported types below.

At this time, the known supported GPU types are the following LLVM Targets.
This table shows some example GPUs that map to these LLVM targets:
| **LLVM Target** | **An Example GPU** |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| gfx900 | Radeon RX Vega 56 |
| gfx906 | Radeon Instinct MI50 |
| gfx908 | Radeon Instinct MI100 |
| gfx90a | Radeon Instinct MI210 |
| gfx940 | Radeon Instinct MI300 |
| gfx941 | |
| gfx942 | |
| gfx1030 | Radeon PRO V620 |
| gfx1100 | Radeon PRO W7900 |
| gfx1101 | Radeon PRO W7700 |
| gfx1102 | Radeon RX 7600 |

AMD is working on enhancing ROCm v6 to broaden support for families of GPUs in a
future release which should increase support for more GPUs.

Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ollama) or file an
[issue](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues) for additional help.

### GPU Selection

If you have multiple AMD GPUs in your system and want to limit Ollama to use a
subset, you can set `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to a comma separated list of GPUs.
You can see the list of devices with `rocminfo`.  If you want to ignore the GPUs
and force CPU usage, use an invalid GPU ID (e.g., "-1")

### Container Permission

In some Linux distributions, SELinux can prevent containers from
accessing the AMD GPU devices.  On the host system you can run 
`sudo setsebool container_use_devices=1` to allow containers to use devices.

### Metal (Apple GPUs)
Ollama supports GPU acceleration on Apple devices via the Metal API.
# Import a model

This guide walks through importing a GGUF, PyTorch or Safetensors model.

## Importing (GGUF)

### Step 1: Write a `Modelfile`

Start by creating a `Modelfile`. This file is the blueprint for your model, specifying weights, parameters, prompt templates and more.

```
FROM ./mistral-7b-v0.1.Q4_0.gguf
```

(Optional) many chat models require a prompt template in order to answer correctly. A default prompt template can be specified with the `TEMPLATE` instruction in the `Modelfile`:

```
FROM ./mistral-7b-v0.1.Q4_0.gguf
TEMPLATE "[INST] {{ .Prompt }} [/INST]"
```

### Step 2: Create the Ollama model

Finally, create a model from your `Modelfile`:

```
ollama create example -f Modelfile
```

### Step 3: Run your model

Next, test the model with `ollama run`:

```
ollama run example "What is your favourite condiment?"
```

## Importing (PyTorch & Safetensors)

> Importing from PyTorch and Safetensors is a longer process than importing from GGUF. Improvements that make it easier are a work in progress.

### Setup

First, clone the `ollama/ollama` repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:ollama/ollama.git ollama
cd ollama
```

and then fetch its `llama.cpp` submodule:

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update llm/llama.cpp
```

Next, install the Python dependencies:

```
python3 -m venv llm/llama.cpp/.venv
source llm/llama.cpp/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r llm/llama.cpp/requirements.txt
```

Then build the `quantize` tool:

```
make -C llm/llama.cpp quantize
```

### Clone the HuggingFace repository (optional)

If the model is currently hosted in a HuggingFace repository, first clone that repository to download the raw model.

Install [Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage), verify it's installed, and then clone the model's repository:

```
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 model
```

### Convert the model

> Note: some model architectures require using specific convert scripts. For example, Qwen models require running `convert-hf-to-gguf.py` instead of `convert.py`

```
python llm/llama.cpp/convert.py ./model --outtype f16 --outfile converted.bin
```

### Quantize the model

```
llm/llama.cpp/quantize converted.bin quantized.bin q4_0
```

### Step 3: Write a `Modelfile`

Next, create a `Modelfile` for your model:

```
FROM quantized.bin
TEMPLATE "[INST] {{ .Prompt }} [/INST]"
```

### Step 4: Create the Ollama model

Finally, create a model from your `Modelfile`:

```
ollama create example -f Modelfile
```

### Step 5: Run your model

Next, test the model with `ollama run`:

```
ollama run example "What is your favourite condiment?"
```

## Publishing your model (optional – early alpha)

Publishing models is in early alpha. If you'd like to publish your model to share with others, follow these steps:

1. Create [an account](https://ollama.com/signup)
2. Copy your Ollama public key:
  - macOS: `cat ~/.ollama/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy`
  - Windows: `type %USERPROFILE%\.ollama\id_ed25519.pub`
  - Linux: `cat /usr/share/ollama/.ollama/id_ed25519.pub`
3. Add your public key to your [Ollama account](https://ollama.com/settings/keys)

Next, copy your model to your username's namespace:

```
ollama cp example <your username>/example
```

> Note: model names may only contain lowercase letters, digits, and the characters `.`, `-`, and `_`.

Then push the model:

```
ollama push <your username>/example
```

After publishing, your model will be available at `https://ollama.com/<your username>/example`.

## Quantization reference

The quantization options are as follow (from highest highest to lowest levels of quantization). Note: some architectures such as Falcon do not support K quants.

- `q2_K`
- `q3_K`
- `q3_K_S`
- `q3_K_M`
- `q3_K_L`
- `q4_0` (recommended)
- `q4_1`
- `q4_K`
- `q4_K_S`
- `q4_K_M`
- `q5_0`
- `q5_1`
- `q5_K`
- `q5_K_S`
- `q5_K_M`
- `q6_K`
- `q8_0`
- `f16`
# Using LangChain with Ollama using JavaScript

In this tutorial, we are going to use JavaScript with LangChain and Ollama to learn about something just a touch more recent. In August 2023, there was a series of wildfires on Maui. There is no way an LLM trained before that time can know about this, since their training data would not include anything as recent as that. So we can find the [Wikipedia article about the fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hawaii_wildfires) and ask questions about the contents.

To get started, let's just use **LangChain** to ask a simple question to a model. To do this with JavaScript, we need to install **LangChain**:

```bash
npm install @langchain/community
```

Now we can start building out our JavaScript:

```javascript
import { Ollama } from "@langchain/community/llms/ollama";

const ollama = new Ollama({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:11434",
  model: "llama3",
});

const answer = await ollama.invoke(`why is the sky blue?`);

console.log(answer);
```

That will get us the same thing as if we ran `ollama run llama3 "why is the sky blue"` in the terminal. But we want to load a document from the web to ask a question against. **Cheerio** is a great library for ingesting a webpage, and **LangChain** uses it in their **CheerioWebBaseLoader**. So let's install **Cheerio** and build that part of the app.

```bash
npm install cheerio
```

```javascript
import { CheerioWebBaseLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/cheerio";

const loader = new CheerioWebBaseLoader("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hawaii_wildfires");
const data = await loader.load();
```

That will load the document. Although this page is smaller than the Odyssey, it is certainly bigger than the context size for most LLMs. So we are going to need to split into smaller pieces, and then select just the pieces relevant to our question. This is a great use for a vector datastore. In this example, we will use the **MemoryVectorStore** that is part of **LangChain**. But there is one more thing we need to get the content into the datastore. We have to run an embeddings process that converts the tokens in the text into a series of vectors. And for that, we are going to use **Tensorflow**. There is a lot of stuff going on in this one. First, install the **Tensorflow** components that we need.

```javascript
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-core@3.6.0 @tensorflow/tfjs-converter@3.6.0 @tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder@1.3.3 @tensorflow/tfjs-node@4.10.0
```

If you just install those components without the version numbers, it will install the latest versions, but there are conflicts within **Tensorflow**, so you need to install the compatible versions.

```javascript
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter"
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
import "@tensorflow/tfjs-node";
import { TensorFlowEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/tensorflow";

// Split the text into 500 character chunks. And overlap each chunk by 20 characters
const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
 chunkSize: 500,
 chunkOverlap: 20
});
const splitDocs = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(data);

// Then use the TensorFlow Embedding to store these chunks in the datastore
const vectorStore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(splitDocs, new TensorFlowEmbeddings());
```

To connect the datastore to a question asked to a LLM, we need to use the concept at the heart of **LangChain**: the chain. Chains are a way to connect a number of activities together to accomplish a particular tasks. There are a number of chain types available, but for this tutorial we are using the **RetrievalQAChain**.

```javascript
import { RetrievalQAChain } from "langchain/chains";

const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever();
const chain = RetrievalQAChain.fromLLM(ollama, retriever);
const result = await chain.call({query: "When was Hawaii's request for a major disaster declaration approved?"});
console.log(result.text)
```

So we created a retriever, which is a way to return the chunks that match a query from a datastore. And then connect the retriever and the model via a chain. Finally, we send a query to the chain, which results in an answer using our document as a source. The answer it returned was correct, August 10, 2023.

And that is a simple introduction to what you can do with **LangChain** and **Ollama.**
# Using LangChain with Ollama in Python

Let's imagine we are studying the classics, such as **the Odyssey** by **Homer**. We might have a question about Neleus and his family. If you ask llama2 for that info, you may get something like:

> I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information on individuals or families that do not exist in reality. Neleus is not a real person or character, and therefore does not have a family or any other personal details. My apologies for any confusion. Is there anything else I can help you with?

This sounds like a typical censored response, but even llama2-uncensored gives a mediocre answer:

> Neleus was a legendary king of Pylos and the father of Nestor, one of the Argonauts. His mother was Clymene, a sea nymph, while his father was Neptune, the god of the sea.

So let's figure out how we can use **LangChain** with Ollama to ask our question to the actual document, the Odyssey by Homer, using Python.

Let's start by asking a simple question that we can get an answer to from the **Llama2** model using **Ollama**. First, we need to install the **LangChain** package:

`pip install langchain_community`

Then we can create a model and ask the question:

```python
from langchain_community.llms import Ollama
ollama = Ollama(
    base_url='http://localhost:11434',
    model="llama3"
)
print(ollama.invoke("why is the sky blue"))
```

Notice that we are defining the model and the base URL for Ollama.

Now let's load a document to ask questions against. I'll load up the Odyssey by Homer, which you can find at Project Gutenberg. We will need **WebBaseLoader** which is part of **LangChain** and loads text from any webpage. On my machine, I also needed to install **bs4** to get that to work, so run `pip install bs4`.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
loader = WebBaseLoader("https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1727/1727-h/1727-h.htm")
data = loader.load()
```

This file is pretty big. Just the preface is 3000 tokens. Which means the full document won't fit into the context for the model. So we need to split it up into smaller pieces.

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter=RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)
all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)
```

It's split up, but we have to find the relevant splits and then submit those to the model. We can do this by creating embeddings and storing them in a vector database. We can use Ollama directly to instantiate an embedding model. We will use ChromaDB in this example for a vector database. `pip install chromadb`

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
oembed = OllamaEmbeddings(base_url="http://localhost:11434", model="nomic-embed-text")
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=oembed)
```

Now let's ask a question from the document. **Who was Neleus, and who is in his family?** Neleus is a character in the Odyssey, and the answer can be found in our text.

```python
question="Who is Neleus and who is in Neleus' family?"
docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(question)
len(docs)
```

This will output the number of matches for chunks of data similar to the search.

The next thing is to send the question and the relevant parts of the docs to the model to see if we can get a good answer. But we are stitching two parts of the process together, and that is called a chain. This means we need to define a chain:

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
qachain=RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(ollama, retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())
qachain.invoke({"query": question})
```

The answer received from this chain was:

> Neleus is a character in Homer's "Odyssey" and is mentioned in the context of Penelope's suitors. Neleus is the father of Chloris, who is married to Neleus and bears him several children, including Nestor, Chromius, Periclymenus, and Pero. Amphinomus, the son of Nisus, is also mentioned as a suitor of Penelope and is known for his good natural disposition and agreeable conversation.

It's not a perfect answer, as it implies Neleus married his daughter when actually Chloris "was the youngest daughter to Amphion son of Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos".

I updated the chunk_overlap for the text splitter to 20 and tried again and got a much better answer:

> Neleus is a character in Homer's epic poem "The Odyssey." He is the husband of Chloris, who is the youngest daughter of Amphion son of Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus. Neleus has several children with Chloris, including Nestor, Chromius, Periclymenus, and Pero.

And that is a much better answer.
# Ollama on Linux

## Install

Install Ollama running this one-liner:

>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

## AMD Radeon GPU support

While AMD has contributed the `amdgpu` driver upstream to the official linux
kernel source, the version is older and may not support all ROCm features. We
recommend you install the latest driver from
https://www.amd.com/en/support/linux-drivers for best support of your Radeon
GPU.

## Manual install

### Download the `ollama` binary

Ollama is distributed as a self-contained binary. Download it to a directory in your PATH:

```bash
sudo curl -L https://ollama.com/download/ollama-linux-amd64 -o /usr/bin/ollama
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ollama
```

### Adding Ollama as a startup service (recommended)

Create a user for Ollama:

```bash
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false -m -d /usr/share/ollama ollama

```

Then start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable ollama
```

### Install CUDA drivers (optional – for Nvidia GPUs)

[Download and install](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) CUDA.

Verify that the drivers are installed by running the following command, which should print details about your GPU:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

### Install ROCm (optional - for Radeon GPUs)
[Download and Install](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/tutorial/quick-start.html)

Make sure to install ROCm v6

### Start Ollama

Start Ollama using `systemd`:

```bash
sudo systemctl start ollama

## Examples

### Basic `Modelfile`

An example of a `Modelfile` creating a mario blueprint:

```modelfile
FROM llama3
# sets the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1
# sets the context window size to 4096, this controls how many tokens the LLM can use as context to generate the next token
PARAMETER num_ctx 4096

# sets a custom system message to specify the behavior of the chat assistant
SYSTEM You are Mario from super mario bros, acting as an assistant.
```

To use this:

1. Save it as a file (e.g. `Modelfile`)
2. `ollama create choose-a-model-name -f <location of the file e.g. ./Modelfile>'`
3. `ollama run choose-a-model-name`
4. Start using the model!

More examples are available in the [examples directory](../examples).

To view the Modelfile of a given model, use the `ollama show --modelfile` command.

  ```bash
  > ollama show --modelfile llama3
  # Modelfile generated by "ollama show"
  # To build a new Modelfile based on this one, replace the FROM line with:
  # FROM llama3:latest
  FROM /Users/pdevine/.ollama/models/blobs/sha256-00e1317cbf74d901080d7100f57580ba8dd8de57203072dc6f668324ba545f29
  TEMPLATE """{{ if .System }}<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

  {{ .System }}<|eot_id|>{{ end }}{{ if .Prompt }}<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

  {{ .Prompt }}<|eot_id|>{{ end }}<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

  {{ .Response }}<|eot_id|>"""
  PARAMETER stop "<|start_header_id|>"
  PARAMETER stop "<|end_header_id|>"
  PARAMETER stop "<|eot_id|>"
  PARAMETER stop "<|reserved_special_token"
  ```

## Instructions

### FROM (Required)

The `FROM` instruction defines the base model to use when creating a model.

```modelfile
FROM <model name>:<tag>
```

#### Build from llama3

```modelfile
FROM llama3
```

A list of available base models:
<https://github.com/ollama/ollama#model-library>

#### Build from a `bin` file

```modelfile
FROM ./ollama-model.bin
```

This bin file location should be specified as an absolute path or relative to the `Modelfile` location.

### PARAMETER

The `PARAMETER` instruction defines a parameter that can be set when the model is run.

```modelfile
PARAMETER <parameter> <parametervalue>
```

#### Valid Parameters and Values

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Value Type | Example Usage        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| mirostat       | Enable Mirostat sampling for controlling perplexity. (default: 0, 0 = disabled, 1 = Mirostat, 2 = Mirostat 2.0)                                                                                                                                         | int        | mirostat 0           |
| mirostat_eta   | Influences how quickly the algorithm responds to feedback from the generated text. A lower learning rate will result in slower adjustments, while a higher learning rate will make the algorithm more responsive. (Default: 0.1)                        | float      | mirostat_eta 0.1     |
| mirostat_tau   | Controls the balance between coherence and diversity of the output. A lower value will result in more focused and coherent text. (Default: 5.0)                                                                                                         | float      | mirostat_tau 5.0     |
| num_ctx        | Sets the size of the context window used to generate the next token. (Default: 2048)                                                                                                                                                                    | int        | num_ctx 4096         |
| repeat_last_n  | Sets how far back for the model to look back to prevent repetition. (Default: 64, 0 = disabled, -1 = num_ctx)                                                                                                                                           | int        | repeat_last_n 64     |
| repeat_penalty | Sets how strongly to penalize repetitions. A higher value (e.g., 1.5) will penalize repetitions more strongly, while a lower value (e.g., 0.9) will be more lenient. (Default: 1.1)                                                                     | float      | repeat_penalty 1.1   |
| temperature    | The temperature of the model. Increasing the temperature will make the model answer more creatively. (Default: 0.8)                                                                                                                                     | float      | temperature 0.7      |
| seed           | Sets the random number seed to use for generation. Setting this to a specific number will make the model generate the same text for the same prompt. (Default: 0)                                                                                       | int        | seed 42              |
| stop           | Sets the stop sequences to use. When this pattern is encountered the LLM will stop generating text and return. Multiple stop patterns may be set by specifying multiple separate `stop` parameters in a modelfile.                                      | string     | stop "AI assistant:" |
| tfs_z          | Tail free sampling is used to reduce the impact of less probable tokens from the output. A higher value (e.g., 2.0) will reduce the impact more, while a value of 1.0 disables this setting. (default: 1)                                               | float      | tfs_z 1              |
| num_predict    | Maximum number of tokens to predict when generating text. (Default: 128, -1 = infinite generation, -2 = fill context)                                                                                                                                   | int        | num_predict 42       |
| top_k          | Reduces the probability of generating nonsense. A higher value (e.g. 100) will give more diverse answers, while a lower value (e.g. 10) will be more conservative. (Default: 40)                                                                        | int        | top_k 40             |
| top_p          | Works together with top-k. A higher value (e.g., 0.95) will lead to more diverse text, while a lower value (e.g., 0.5) will generate more focused and conservative text. (Default: 0.9)                                                                 | float      | top_p 0.9            |

### TEMPLATE

`TEMPLATE` of the full prompt template to be passed into the model. It may include (optionally) a system message, a user's message and the response from the model. Note: syntax may be model specific. Templates use Go [template syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).

#### Template Variables

| Variable          | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{ .System }}`   | The system message used to specify custom behavior.                                           |
| `{{ .Prompt }}`   | The user prompt message.                                                                      |
| `{{ .Response }}` | The response from the model. When generating a response, text after this variable is omitted. |

```
TEMPLATE """{{ if .System }}<|im_start|>system
{{ .System }}<|im_end|>
{{ end }}{{ if .Prompt }}<|im_start|>user
{{ .Prompt }}<|im_end|>
{{ end }}<|im_start|>assistant
"""
```

### SYSTEM

The `SYSTEM` instruction specifies the system message to be used in the template, if applicable.

```modelfile
SYSTEM """<system message>"""
```

### ADAPTER

The `ADAPTER` instruction is an optional instruction that specifies any LoRA adapter that should apply to the base model. The value of this instruction should be an absolute path or a path relative to the Modelfile and the file must be in a GGML file format. The adapter should be tuned from the base model otherwise the behaviour is undefined.

```modelfile
ADAPTER ./ollama-lora.bin
```

### LICENSE

The `LICENSE` instruction allows you to specify the legal license under which the model used with this Modelfile is shared or distributed.

```modelfile
LICENSE """
<license text>
"""
```

### MESSAGE

The `MESSAGE` instruction allows you to specify a message history for the model to use when responding. Use multiple iterations of the MESSAGE command to build up a conversation which will guide the model to answer in a similar way.

```modelfile
MESSAGE <role> <message>
```

#### Valid roles

| Role      | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| system    | Alternate way of providing the SYSTEM message for the model. |
| user      | An example message of what the user could have asked.        |
| assistant | An example message of how the model should respond.          |


#### Example conversation

```modelfile
MESSAGE user Is Toronto in Canada?
MESSAGE assistant yes
MESSAGE user Is Sacramento in Canada?
MESSAGE assistant no
MESSAGE user Is Ontario in Canada?
MESSAGE assistant yes
```


## Notes

- the **`Modelfile` is not case sensitive**. In the examples, uppercase instructions are used to make it easier to distinguish it from arguments.
- Instructions can be in any order. In the examples, the `FROM` instruction is first to keep it easily readable.

# Running Ollama on NVIDIA Jetson Devices

Ollama runs well on [NVIDIA Jetson Devices](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/) and should run out of the box with the standard installation instructions. 

The following has been tested on [JetPack 5.1.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack), but should also work on JetPack 6.0.

- Install Ollama via standard Linux command (ignore the 404 error): `curl https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
- Pull the model you want to use (e.g. mistral): `ollama pull mistral`
- Start an interactive session: `ollama run mistral`

And that's it!

# Running Ollama in Docker

When running GPU accelerated applications in Docker, it is highly recommended to use [dusty-nv jetson-containers repo](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers).# OpenAI compatibility

> **Note:** OpenAI compatibility is experimental and is subject to major adjustments including breaking changes. For fully-featured access to the Ollama API, see the Ollama [Python library](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python), [JavaScript library](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js) and [REST API](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md).

Ollama provides experimental compatibility with parts of the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) to help connect existing applications to Ollama.

## Usage

### OpenAI Python library

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1/',

    # required but ignored
    api_key='ollama',
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': 'Say this is a test',
        }
    ],
    model='llama3',
)
```

### OpenAI JavaScript library

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:11434/v1/',

  // required but ignored
  apiKey: 'ollama',
})

const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
  model: 'llama3',
})
```

### `curl`

```
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "llama3",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hello!"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

## Models

Before using a model, pull it locally `ollama pull`:

```shell
ollama pull llama3
```

### Default model names

For tooling that relies on default OpenAI model names such as `gpt-3.5-turbo`, use `ollama cp` to copy an existing model name to a temporary name:

```
ollama cp llama3 gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Afterwards, this new model name can be specified the `model` field:

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hello!"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

# How to troubleshoot issues

Sometimes Ollama may not perform as expected. One of the best ways to figure out what happened is to take a look at the logs. Find the logs on **Mac** by running the command:

```shell
cat ~/.ollama/logs/server.log
```

On **Linux** systems with systemd, the logs can be found with this command:

```shell
journalctl -u ollama
```

When you run Ollama in a **container**, the logs go to stdout/stderr in the container:

```shell
docker logs <container-name>
```
(Use `docker ps` to find the container name)

If manually running `ollama serve` in a terminal, the logs will be on that terminal.

When you run Ollama on **Windows**, there are a few different locations. You can view them in the explorer window by hitting `<cmd>+R` and type in:
- `explorer %LOCALAPPDATA%\Ollama` to view logs
- `explorer %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ollama` to browse the binaries (The installer adds this to your user PATH)
- `explorer %HOMEPATH%\.ollama` to browse where models and configuration is stored
- `explorer %TEMP%` where temporary executable files are stored in one or more `ollama*` directories

To enable additional debug logging to help troubleshoot problems, first **Quit the running app from the tray menu** then in a powershell terminal
```powershell
$env:OLLAMA_DEBUG="1"
& "ollama app.exe"
```

Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ollama) for help interpreting the logs.

## LLM libraries

Ollama includes multiple LLM libraries compiled for different GPUs and CPU vector features. Ollama tries to pick the best one based on the capabilities of your system. If this autodetection has problems, or you run into other problems (e.g. crashes in your GPU) you can workaround this by forcing a specific LLM library. `cpu_avx2` will perform the best, followed by `cpu_avx` an the slowest but most compatible is `cpu`. Rosetta emulation under MacOS will work with the `cpu` library. 

In the server log, you will see a message that looks something like this (varies from release to release):

```
Dynamic LLM libraries [rocm_v6 cpu cpu_avx cpu_avx2 cuda_v11 rocm_v5]
```

**Experimental LLM Library Override**

You can set OLLAMA_LLM_LIBRARY to any of the available LLM libraries to bypass autodetection, so for example, if you have a CUDA card, but want to force the CPU LLM library with AVX2 vector support, use:

```
OLLAMA_LLM_LIBRARY="cpu_avx2" ollama serve
```

You can see what features your CPU has with the following.
```
cat /proc/cpuinfo| grep flags | head -1
```

## Installing older or pre-release versions on Linux

If you run into problems on Linux and want to install an older version, or you'd like to try out a pre-release before it's officially released, you can tell the install script which version to install.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | OLLAMA_VERSION="0.1.29" sh
```

## Linux tmp noexec 

If your system is configured with the "noexec" flag where Ollama stores its temporary executable files, you can specify an alternate location by setting OLLAMA_TMPDIR to a location writable by the user ollama runs as. For example OLLAMA_TMPDIR=/usr/share/ollama/

## Container fails to run on NVIDIA GPU

Make sure you've set up the container runtime first as described in [docker.md](./docker.md)

Sometimes the container runtime can have difficulties initializing the GPU. When you check the server logs, this can show up as various error codes, such as "3" (not initialized), "46" (device unavailable), "100" (no device), "999" (unknown), or others. The following troubleshooting techniques may help resolve the problem

- Is the uvm driver not loaded? `sudo nvidia-modprobe -u`
- Try reloading the nvidia_uvm driver - `sudo rmmod nvidia_uvm` then `sudo modprobe nvidia_uvm`
- Try rebooting
- Make sure you're running the latest nvidia drivers

If none of those resolve the problem, gather additional information and file an issue:
- Set `CUDA_ERROR_LEVEL=50` and try again to get more diagnostic logs
- Check dmesg for any errors `sudo dmesg | grep -i nvrm` and `sudo dmesg | grep -i nvidia`

# Ollama Windows Preview

Welcome to the Ollama Windows preview.

No more WSL required!

Ollama now runs as a native Windows application, including NVIDIA and AMD Radeon GPU support.
After installing Ollama Windows Preview, Ollama will run in the background and
the `ollama` command line is available in `cmd`, `powershell` or your favorite
terminal application. As usual the Ollama [api](./api.md) will be served on
`http://localhost:11434`.

As this is a preview release, you should expect a few bugs here and there.  If
you run into a problem you can reach out on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/ollama), or file an
[issue](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues).
Logs will often be helpful in diagnosing the problem (see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below)

## System Requirements

* Windows 10 or newer, Home or Pro
* NVIDIA 452.39 or newer Drivers if you have an NVIDIA card
* AMD Radeon Driver https://www.amd.com/en/support if you have a Radeon card

## API Access

Here's a quick example showing API access from `powershell`
```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -method POST -Body '{"model":"llama3", "prompt":"Why is the sky blue?", "stream": false}' -uri http://localhost:11434/api/generate ).Content | ConvertFrom-json
```

## Troubleshooting

While we're in preview, `OLLAMA_DEBUG` is always enabled, which adds
a "view logs" menu item to the app, and increases logging for the GUI app and
server.

Ollama on Windows stores files in a few different locations.  You can view them in
the explorer window by hitting `<cmd>+R` and type in:
- `explorer %LOCALAPPDATA%\Ollama` contains logs, and downloaded updates
    - *app.log* contains logs from the GUI application
    - *server.log* contains the server logs
    - *upgrade.log* contains log output for upgrades
- `explorer %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ollama` contains the binaries (The installer adds this to your user PATH)
- `explorer %HOMEPATH%\.ollama` contains models and configuration
- `explorer %TEMP%` contains temporary executable files in one or more `ollama*` directories


## Standalone CLI

The easiest way to install Ollama on Windows is to use the `OllamaSetup.exe`
installer. It installs in your account without requiring Administrator rights.
We update Ollama regularly to support the latest models, and this installer will
help you keep up to date.

If you'd like to install or integrate Ollama as a service, a standalone
`ollama-windows-amd64.zip` zip file is available containing only the Ollama CLI
and GPU library dependencies for Nvidia and AMD. This allows for embedding
Ollama in existing applications, or running it as a system service via `ollama
serve` with tools such as [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/).
